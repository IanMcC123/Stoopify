We added a header, footer and a hero section.

Today, these are the features that were created: Stoopify Title, Search Bar, Login Button, and Cart Button.

In Figma, every object was grouped for accessiblity. For example, header, footer and etc.. Moving forward, we will be following the same format when creating other pages.
